Hello there, Thank you for showing interest in this repo.

<h1>Responsive React Navbar</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

This is my first project I built with react. It is a simple responsive navigation bar. Since I am just starting out my React journey, why not build a navbar as it is the starting point of most modern websites.

<h2>Features</h2>
Vite played a major role in this project as I used it to install react locally. In case you don't know vite is a fast and lightweight build tool that makes it easy to set up a new react project.<br/>

Styling was done with tailwindcss. Ever since I tried tailwindcss, I have never looked back since.

<h2>Running the Project</h2>
You can run the project on your local machine by cloning it. After that you need to <code>cd into the project directory</code> then run <code>npm install</code> to install all necessary dependencies. Now you can run <code>npm run dev</code> to see a live view of the project.
